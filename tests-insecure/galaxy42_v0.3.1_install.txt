## Release notes

### Version v0.3.1

* For users of official binary distribution:
  * On Windows, you still need to manually get and install a TUN/TAP driver (e.g. from OpenVPN, it's open source).
  * Connections could be now authenticated, how ever this probably still has bugs, do not use in production.
  * Connections are now more realiable, they should keep working when your peer changes IP address (unless you both change it around same time).
  * You can try to use this software to build small mesh networks (e.g. < 1000 nodes, and max distance < 4 hops), but:
    * Only with trusted peers (no protection against any DoS).
    * It is not fully supported to have 2 nodes running behind one NAT (seen by other nodes as same IP), try connecting them to eachother via LAN too.
* For people building from source:
  * Our builds are now using CI from also Jenkins, in addition to Travis. We are doing it, but you can too (see doc/ folder).
  * Building Gitian for Windows finally should be deterministic (fixed NSIS makensis tool date) even if you will reproduce the builds at other date (day).
* Misc:
  * You can now use ./do also on Cygwin.
  * Merry Christmas 2016 :-) !
